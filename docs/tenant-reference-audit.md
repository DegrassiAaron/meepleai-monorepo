# Tenant Reference Audit (Archived)

> Last updated: 2024-01-14

## Findings

- Tenant-specific references have been removed from code and docs.
- Configuration, schemas, and user-facing copy no longer mention tenancy.

## Next Steps

- No remediation is required right now.
- Monitor new contributions to avoid tenant-bound assumptions returning.

## Archive Note

This document is kept for historical context.
Remove it during a future cleanup if tenancy scope changes again.
