# Security Audit Report - SEC-04

**Issue**: #264 - SEC-04 - Security Audit and SAST Integration
**Date**: 2025-10-10
**Auditor**: Claude Code (AI Assistant)
**Priority**: P0
**Status**: In Progress

## Executive Summary

This document presents a comprehensive security audit of the MeepleAI monorepo and proposes enhanced SAST (Static Application Security Testing) integration to strengthen the security posture beyond the existing SEC-03 implementation.

### Current Security Status

✅ **Strengths**:
- No known vulnerabilities in current dependencies (.NET and npm)
- CodeQL SAST already integrated for C# and JavaScript/TypeScript
- Dependency scanning active with HIGH/CRITICAL failure thresholds
- SecurityCodeScan.VS2019 and Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.NetAnalyzers in place
- Dependabot configured for automated dependency updates
- Weekly security scans on schedule

⚠️ **Gaps Identified**:
- Limited to single SAST tool (CodeQL)
- No multi-language SAST coverage beyond CodeQL
- No secrets scanning in CI/CD
- No container security scanning
- No infrastructure-as-code (IaC) security scanning
- Limited runtime application self-protection (RASP)

## Current Implementation Analysis (SEC-03)

### Existing Tools

| Tool | Purpose | Coverage | Status |
|------|---------|----------|--------|
| CodeQL | SAST (C#, JS/TS) | Code security patterns | ✅ Active |
| SecurityCodeScan.VS2019 | .NET security analyzer | SQL injection, XSS, crypto | ✅ Active |
| Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.NetAnalyzers | .NET code quality | Code analysis | ✅ Active |
| dotnet list package | .NET dependency scan | NuGet vulnerabilities | ✅ Active |
| pnpm audit | Frontend dependency scan | npm vulnerabilities | ✅ Active |
| Dependabot | Dependency updates | Auto-patching | ✅ Active |

### Workflow Configuration

**File**: `.github/workflows/security-scan.yml`

**Jobs**:
1. `codeql-analysis` - SAST for C# and JavaScript
2. `dependency-scan` - Vulnerability scanning for .NET and npm
3. `dotnet-security-scan` - .NET-specific security analysis
4. `security-summary` - Aggregated results

**Triggers**:
- Push to main
- Pull requests
- Weekly schedule (Mondays)
- Manual dispatch

## SAST Tool Evaluation

### Semgrep vs Snyk Comparison

#### Semgrep

**Pros**:
- ✅ Open-source and free for basic use
- ✅ Supports 30+ languages including C#, TypeScript, JavaScript, Python
- ✅ Native GitHub Actions integration
- ✅ Fast execution (optimized for CI/CD)
- ✅ Custom rule creation with simple pattern syntax
- ✅ SARIF output for GitHub Security tab
- ✅ AI-assisted analysis in Pro version
- ✅ Reduces false positives by 25% (cross-file/cross-function analysis)
- ✅ Increases true positives by 250%
- ✅ Secrets detection capability

**Cons**:
- ⚠️ Full features require Semgrep AppSec Platform (paid)
- ⚠️ semgrep-action deprecated (use native support)

**Recommended Action**: **INTEGRATE** - Excellent free tier, modern tooling, strong community

#### Snyk

**Pros**:
- ✅ Comprehensive SAST, SCA, and container scanning
- ✅ Strong GitHub Actions integration
- ✅ SARIF support for GitHub Security tab
- ✅ Advanced vulnerability database
- ✅ Developer-friendly CLI and IDE plugins

**Cons**:
- ⚠️ Free tier limited (200 tests/month)
- ⚠️ Moving to closed-contribution model (August 2025)
- ⚠️ Requires API token for full features
- ⚠️ Potential vendor lock-in

**Recommended Action**: **EVALUATE** - Consider for paid tier if budget allows

### Recommendation: Semgrep Integration

**Primary choice**: Semgrep
**Rationale**:
- Free and open-source
- Complements CodeQL with different rule sets
- Better coverage for custom security patterns
- Faster execution in CI/CD
- Active development and strong community
- Secrets scanning included

## Enhanced Security Strategy

### Layer 1: Multi-Tool SAST

**Proposed Architecture**:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│          SAST Layer                      │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  CodeQL      → GitHub native SAST       │
│  Semgrep     → Multi-language patterns  │
│  SecCodeScan → .NET specific            │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Benefits**:
- Defense in depth (multiple tools catch different issues)
- Reduced false negatives
- Broader vulnerability coverage

### Layer 2: Enhanced Dependency Scanning

**Current**: dotnet + pnpm audit
**Enhancement**: Add transitive dependency analysis

**Proposed workflow**:
```yaml
- name: Deep Dependency Scan
  run: |
    dotnet list package --vulnerable --include-transitive --format json
    pnpm audit --audit-level=moderate --json
```json
### Layer 3: Secrets Detection

**Gap**: No secrets scanning in current pipeline

**Proposed tools**:
1. **Semgrep secrets** (integrated with Semgrep SAST)
2. **GitHub secret scanning** (if available on repo)
3. **Pre-commit hooks** (already exist, ensure secrets rules)

**Implementation**:
```yaml
- name: Scan for Secrets
  uses: semgrep/semgrep-action@v1
  with:
    config: >-
      p/security-audit
      p/secrets
```

### Layer 4: Container Security

**Gap**: Docker images not scanned for vulnerabilities

**Proposed tool**: Trivy (free, open-source)

**Implementation**:
```yaml
- name: Scan Docker Images
  uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@master
  with:
    image-ref: 'meepleai-api:latest'
    format: 'sarif'
    output: 'trivy-results.sarif'
```json
### Layer 5: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Security

**Gap**: Docker Compose and GitHub Actions not security-scanned

**Proposed tool**: Checkov or tfsec

**Target files**:
- `infra/docker-compose.yml`
- `.github/workflows/*.yml`

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Semgrep Integration (Week 1)

**Tasks**:
1. Add Semgrep job to security-scan.yml
2. Configure Semgrep rules (security-audit, secrets, owasp-top-10)
3. Set up SARIF upload to GitHub Security tab
4. Test on current codebase
5. Document findings

**Expected outcome**: Additional SAST coverage, secrets detection

### Phase 2: Container & IaC Security (Week 2)

**Tasks**:
1. Add Trivy container scanning
2. Add Checkov IaC scanning for Docker Compose
3. Integrate results into security summary
4. Configure failure thresholds

**Expected outcome**: Complete infrastructure security coverage

### Phase 3: Enhanced Dependency Scanning (Week 3)

**Tasks**:
1. Add JSON output for dependency scans
2. Create vulnerability trend tracking
3. Implement automated remediation suggestions
4. Update documentation

**Expected outcome**: Better vulnerability tracking and remediation

### Phase 4: Security Dashboard & Metrics (Week 4)

**Tasks**:
1. Create security metrics collection
2. Build security dashboard (optional)
3. Implement automated reporting
4. Train team on new tools

**Expected outcome**: Visibility into security posture over time

- Prioritize by severity and exploitability

### Risk 3: Tool Maintenance Overhead

**Impact**: LOW
**Mitigation**:
- Automated rule updates via Dependabot
- Quarterly tool evaluation reviews
- Team training on tool usage
- Clear escalation procedures
