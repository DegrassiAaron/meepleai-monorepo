# RULE-02: RuleSpec Versioning and Diff - Implementation Summary

**Issue ID**: RULE-02
**Title**: Versioning e diff RuleSpec
**Status**: COMPLETED
**Date**: 2025-10-16

## Overview

RULE-02 implements comprehensive versioning and diff functionality for RuleSpec documents, enabling teams to track changes to game rules over time, compare versions, and maintain a complete audit trail.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] **UI diff**: Visual diff viewer for comparing RuleSpec versions
- [x] **Audit trail**: Complete logging of all RuleSpec modifications

## Implementation Details

### Backend Components

#### 1. RuleSpecDiffService (`src/Api/Services/RuleSpecDiffService.cs`)

Core service for computing differences between RuleSpec versions.

**Features**:
- Computes field-level differences between two RuleSpec versions
- Identifies added, modified, deleted, and unchanged rules
- Generates human-readable diff summaries
- Tracks changes at the RuleAtom level

**Key Methods**:
- `ComputeDiff(RuleSpec from, RuleSpec to)`: Main diff computation
- `CompareAtoms(RuleAtom from, RuleAtom to)`: Field-level comparison
- `GenerateDiffSummary(RuleSpecDiff diff)`: Human-readable output

**Test Coverage**: 24 unit tests (100% passing)

#### 2. RuleSpecService Versioning Methods

**Implemented Endpoints**:
- `GetVersionHistoryAsync(gameId)`: Returns all versions for a game
- `GetVersionAsync(gameId, version)`: Retrieves specific version
- `UpdateRuleSpecAsync()`: Creates new version on update

#### 3. API Endpoints (`src/Api/Program.cs` lines 1658-1734)

**Version History**:
```
GET /api/v1/games/{gameId}/rulespec/history
```
Returns:
```json
{
  "gameId": "string",
  "totalVersions": 0,
  "versions": [
    {
      "version": "v1",
      "createdAt": "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z",
      "ruleCount": 10,
      "createdBy": "user@example.com"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Get Specific Version**:
```
GET /api/v1/games/{gameId}/rulespec/versions/{version}
```

**Compare Versions (Diff)**:
```
GET /api/v1/games/{gameId}/rulespec/diff?from=v1&to=v2
```yaml
Returns:
```json
{
  "gameId": "string",
  "fromVersion": "v1",
  "toVersion": "v2",
  "fromCreatedAt": "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "toCreatedAt": "2025-01-02T00:00:00Z",
  "summary": {
    "totalChanges": 3,
    "added": 1,
    "modified": 1,
    "deleted": 1,
    "unchanged": 7
  },
  "changes": [
    {
      "type": "Added",
      "newAtom": "rule-id",
      "newValue": { ... }
    }
  ]
}
```json
**Authorization**: Editor and Admin roles required for all endpoints

#### 4. Audit Trail

All RuleSpec updates are logged via `AuditService.LogAsync()`:
- Action: `UPDATE_RULESPEC`
- User tracking
- IP address and User-Agent logging
- Version tracking

### Frontend Components

#### 1. Version History Page (`src/pages/versions.tsx`)

Complete UI for version management with:
- Version list sidebar showing all versions chronologically
- Current version highlighting
- Version restoration capability (creates new version)
- Integrated diff viewer
- Comments section integration
- Error handling and loading states

**Key Features**:
- Auto-selects two most recent versions for comparison
- Toggle between "show only changes" and "show all"
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- Real-time feedback on operations

#### 2. DiffViewer Component (`src/components/DiffViewer.tsx`)

Visual diff display component:
- Integrates DiffSummary and ChangeItem components
- Filterable view (only changes vs. all)
- Empty state handling
- Responsive layout

**Test Coverage**: 8 unit tests (100% passing)

#### 3. DiffSummary Component (`src/components/DiffSummary.tsx`)

Summary statistics display:
- Color-coded change counts (green for added, orange for modified, red for deleted)
- Visual grid layout
- Data-testid attributes for testing

**Test Coverage**: Complete unit tests

#### 4. ChangeItem Component (`src/components/ChangeItem.tsx`)

Individual change visualization:
- Type-specific styling (Added, Modified, Deleted, Unchanged)
- Field-level diff for modifications (before/after comparison)
- Icon indicators
- Metadata display (section, page, line)

**Test Coverage**: 10 unit tests (100% passing)

## Testing

### Backend Tests

**Unit Tests** (`RuleSpecDiffServiceTests.cs`): 24 tests
- Empty specs comparison
- Single rule addition/deletion
- Multiple simultaneous changes
- Field-level modifications
- Identical spec comparison
- Human-readable summary generation

**Integration Tests** (`RuleSpecHistoryIntegrationTests.cs`): 17 tests
- GET /history endpoint (authenticated, unauthorized, forbidden)
- GET /versions/{version} endpoint (success, not found, auth)
- GET /diff endpoint (success, validation, missing versions, auth)
- Multi-version workflow testing
- Role-based access control

**Total Backend Tests**: 153 RuleSpec-related tests (all passing)

### Frontend Tests

**Unit Tests**:
- `versions.test.tsx`: 9 tests (page component)
- `DiffViewer.test.tsx`: 8 tests
- `ChangeItem.test.tsx`: 10 tests
- `DiffSummary.test.tsx`: Complete coverage

**E2E Tests** (`e2e/versions.spec.ts`): 5 comprehensive scenarios
1. Full workflow: history, diff, restore
2. Unauthenticated access handling
3. Error state handling
4. Comments integration (add, edit, delete)
5. Empty state handling

**Total Frontend Tests**: 32+ tests covering versioning (all passing)

### Test Execution Results

```
Backend (API):
  Passed: 153/153 tests
  Duration: ~17s
  Filter: FullyQualifiedName~RuleSpec

Frontend (Web):
  Passed: All versioning-related tests
  - versions.test.tsx: 9/9
  - DiffViewer.test.tsx: 8/8
  - ChangeItem.test.tsx: 10/10
  - DiffSummary.test.tsx: All passing
  - E2E versions.spec.ts: 5/5
```

## Database Schema

RuleSpec versions are stored with:
- `rule_specs.Version`: Version string (e.g., "v1", "v2")
- `rule_specs.CreatedAt`: Timestamp
- `rule_specs.CreatedByUserId`: User tracking
- Unique constraint on `(GameId, Version)`

No migration required - existing schema supports versioning.

## Security & Authorization

**Role Requirements**:
- **Editor**: Can view history, versions, diffs, and restore versions
- **Admin**: Full access (same as Editor for versioning)
- **User**: No access (403 Forbidden)

**Audit Logging**:
- All version updates logged to `audit_logs` table
- Includes user ID, IP address, user agent
- Action type: `UPDATE_RULESPEC`

## User Workflows

### 1. View Version History
1. Navigate to `/versions?gameId={gameId}`
2. View list of all versions in sidebar
3. See metadata: version, date, rule count, creator

### 2. Compare Versions
1. Select "From" version in dropdown
2. Select "To" version in dropdown
3. View auto-generated diff with summary
4. Toggle "Show only changes" for focused view

### 3. Restore Previous Version
1. Click "Ripristina" button on non-current version
2. Confirm restoration dialog
3. System creates new version with restored content
4. Success message displayed with new version number

### 4. Add Comments to Version
1. Select version to view
2. Scroll to comments section
3. Add, edit, or delete comments
4. Comments persist per version

## Performance Considerations

**Optimization**:
- Diff computation is O(n) where n = number of rules
- Dictionary-based lookups for efficient comparison
- Frontend filters applied client-side for instant UX
- Version history sorted server-side

**Caching**: Not currently implemented (future enhancement: AI-05)

- **DB-01**: Database schema supporting versioning
- **AUTH-01**: Role-based access control

**Future Enhancements**:
