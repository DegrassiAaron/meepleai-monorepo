## Recommendations

Based on the audit findings, the following actions are recommended:

### Priority 1: Critical & Serious Issues
These **MUST** be fixed before considering the application WCAG 2.1 AA compliant.

- [ ] Fix `color-contrast` across all affected pages
- [ ] Fix `document-title` across all affected pages
- [ ] Fix `html-has-lang` across all affected pages

### Priority 2: Moderate Issues

These **SHOULD** be addressed to improve accessibility.

‚úÖ No moderate issues found!

### Priority 3: Minor Issues

These can be addressed in future iterations.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Review this report** with the development team
2. **Create fix tasks** for critical and serious issues (Fase 5 of UI-05)
3. **Implement accessible components** using Magic MCP (Fase 4 of UI-05)
4. **Add automated tests** to prevent regressions (Fase 3 of UI-05)
5. **Perform manual testing** with keyboard and screen reader (Fase 6 of UI-05)
6. **Re-run audit** after fixes are implemented
