# Upload Page Tests - Modular Structure

This directory contains modular test files for the `upload.tsx` page, organized by workflow step following BDD principles.

## 📁 Test File Organization

The original monolithic `upload.test.tsx` (1972 lines, 29 tests) has been split into 4 focused test files:

| File | Tests | Lines | Responsibility |
|------|-------|-------|----------------|
| `upload.game-selection.test.tsx` | 6 | 188 | Game CRUD and selection workflow |
| `upload.pdf-upload.test.tsx` | 12 | 613 | PDF upload, polling, and retry logic |
| `upload.review-edit.test.tsx` | 9 | 458 | RuleSpec editing and publishing |
| `upload.edge-cases.test.tsx` | 4 | 131 | Authorization and error scenarios |
| **Total** | **31** | **1390** | |

### Shared Fixtures

**File**: `src/__tests__/fixtures/upload-mocks.ts` (272 lines)

Provides reusable mock factories to reduce duplication:
- `createAuthMock()` - Authentication responses
- `createGameMock()` - Game objects
- `createPdfMock()` - PDF documents (with status/processingStatus variants)
- `createRuleSpecMock()` - RuleSpec objects
- `setupUploadMocks()` - Comprehensive fetch mock router

**Benefits**:
- **-16% total LOC** (1662 total vs 1972 original)
- **~80% reduction** in mock setup duplication per test
- **Type-safe** mock configurations
- **Fully tested** fixture with 31 BDD-style tests

## 🧪 Running Tests

```bash
# Run all upload tests
pnpm test upload.game-selection upload.pdf-upload upload.review-edit upload.edge-cases

# Run specific workflow tests
pnpm test upload.game-selection      # Game selection only
pnpm test upload.pdf-upload           # PDF upload only
pnpm test upload.review-edit          # Review & edit only
pnpm test upload.edge-cases           # Edge cases only

# Run with coverage
pnpm test upload.game-selection upload.pdf-upload upload.review-edit upload.edge-cases --coverage

# Run in watch mode
pnpm test --watch upload.game-selection
```

## 🎯 BDD Test Structure

All tests follow Given-When-Then BDD format:

```typescript
describe('Given user has existing games', () => {
  describe('When user confirms game selection', () => {
    it('Then upload button becomes enabled with file selected', async () => {
      // Test implementation
    });
  });
});
```

### Example: Using Shared Fixtures

```typescript
import {
  setupUploadMocks,
  createAuthMock,
  createGameMock,
  createPdfMock,
  createRuleSpecMock
} from '../../__tests__/fixtures/upload-mocks';

// Before: 50+ lines of mock setup per test
// After: 10 lines with fixture
const mockFetch = setupUploadMocks({
  auth: createAuthMock({ userId: 'user-1', role: 'Admin' }),
  games: [createGameMock({ id: 'game-1', name: 'Terraforming Mars' })],
  pdfs: { pdfs: [] },
  uploadResponse: { documentId: 'pdf-123' },
  pdfStatusSequence: [
    { processingStatus: 'processing' },
    { processingStatus: 'completed' }
  ],
  ruleSpec: createRuleSpecMock({ gameId: 'game-1' })
});

global.fetch = mockFetch as unknown as typeof fetch;
```

## 📊 Test Coverage

Current coverage for `upload.tsx`:
- **Lines**: 66.21%
- **Functions**: 47.91%
- **Statements**: 65.01%
- **Branches**: 68.93%

**Note**: Coverage is intentionally focused on critical paths. The modular structure makes it easier to identify and add tests for uncovered scenarios.

## 🔍 Test Workflow Mapping

### Step 1: Game Selection (`upload.game-selection.test.tsx`)

**Covers**:
- Selecting existing games
- Creating new games
- Game confirmation validation
- Auto-selection behavior

**Key Scenarios**:
- ✅ Upload disabled until game confirmed
- ✅ Create new game when none exist
- ✅ Game creation failure handling
- ✅ Empty game name validation

### Step 2: PDF Upload (`upload.pdf-upload.test.tsx`)

**Covers**:
- PDF upload and status polling
- Retry failed PDF parsing
- PDF list display
- File size formatting
- Log viewing

**Key Scenarios**:
- ✅ Polling with processing → completed sequence
- ✅ Network error during polling with recovery
- ✅ Upload request failures
- ✅ Failed PDF retry functionality
- ✅ PDF list error handling

### Step 3: Review & Edit (`upload.review-edit.test.tsx`)

**Covers**:
- RuleSpec loading
- Rule atom CRUD operations
- Publishing RuleSpec
- Wizard state management

**Key Scenarios**:
- ✅ Edit rule atom text
- ✅ Delete rule atom
- ✅ Add new rule atom
- ✅ Publish RuleSpec successfully
- ✅ Publishing failure handling
- ✅ RuleSpec load failures
- ✅ Wizard reset

### Step 4: Edge Cases (`upload.edge-cases.test.tsx`)

**Covers**:
- Authorization checks
- Authentication requirements
- Parse failure scenarios

**Key Scenarios**:
- ✅ Viewer role blocked from access
- ✅ Unauthenticated user handling
- ✅ PDF processing failure with error details

## 🚀 Adding New Tests

When adding new upload tests:

1. **Identify the workflow step** (game-selection, pdf-upload, review-edit, edge-cases)
2. **Use BDD Given-When-Then structure**
3. **Leverage shared fixtures** from `upload-mocks.ts`
4. **Keep files under 400 lines** (split further if needed)
5. **Write test name as scenario** (e.g., "Then error message is displayed")

### Example Template

```typescript
describe('Given [initial state]', () => {
  describe('When [action occurs]', () => {
    it('Then [expected outcome]', async () => {
      // Arrange
      const mockFetch = setupUploadMocks({ /* config */ });
      global.fetch = mockFetch as unknown as typeof fetch;

      // Act
      render(<UploadPage />);
      // ... user interactions

      // Assert
      await waitFor(() => {
        expect(screen.getByText(/expected text/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
      });
    });
  });
});
```

## 🎨 Naming Conventions

- **Test files**: `upload.<workflow-step>.test.tsx`
- **Describe blocks**: Given-When-Then hierarchy
- **Test names**: Complete "Then" assertions
- **Mock factories**: `create<Entity>Mock()`
- **Setup function**: `setupUploadMocks()`

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Tests failing after fixture changes

1. Check that `upload-mocks.test.ts` still passes
2. Verify mock signatures match expected types
3. Run `pnpm test upload-mocks` to validate fixtures

### Coverage dropped

1. Ensure all workflow steps are tested
2. Check if new code paths were added to `upload.tsx`
3. Add focused tests for uncovered scenarios

### Fake timers cleanup

All tests using `jest.useFakeTimers()` must have:
```typescript
afterEach(() => {
  jest.useRealTimers();
});

// In test with timers
try {
  jest.useFakeTimers();
  // ... test code
} finally {
  jest.useRealTimers();
}
```

This prevents timer leaks affecting other tests (see [Issue #322](https://github.com/DegrassiAaron/meepleai-monorepo/issues/322)).
