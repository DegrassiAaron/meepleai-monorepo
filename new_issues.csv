DB-04,Apply Pending UserSessions Migration,"Execute database update to apply the AddLastSeenAtAndRevokedAtToUserSessions migration that adds LastSeenAt and RevokedAt columns to user_sessions table.",DB,Task,P0,1,"area/db,kind/migration",MVP,DB-01,Migration applied successfully; columns visible in database schema.
PDF-04,Integrate PDF Parser (Tabula/Camelot),"Implement TODO from RuleSpecService.cs:60 - integrate Tabula/Camelot PDF table parser via sidecar service for improved extraction and normalization into RuleSpec format.",PDF,Feature,P1,5,"area/pdf,area/rulespec,kind/feature",V1,PDF-02,Sidecar service deployed; table extraction working on test PDFs; atomic rules correctly generated.
AUTH-03,Session Management Service with Auto-Revocation,"Build service layer to manage user sessions using new LastSeenAt/RevokedAt fields. Implement activity tracking, auto-revocation of inactive sessions, and manual revocation endpoints.",Auth,Feature,P1,3,"area/auth,kind/feature",V1,"AUTH-01,DB-04",Service tracks LastSeenAt on requests; auto-revokes sessions after configurable timeout; admin can revoke sessions manually.
PERF-02,Implement Redis Token Bucket Rate Limiting,"Add rate limiting middleware using Redis token bucket algorithm to protect API endpoints from abuse. Configure per-endpoint limits and user-specific quotas.",Perf,Feature,P1,3,"area/perf,area/security,kind/feature",V1,INF-01,"Rate limiting active on critical endpoints; 429 responses with Retry-After headers; Redis stores token buckets."
API-04,API Key Management and Quota System,"Implement API key generation, rotation, revocation, and per-key quota management for external API consumers. Add endpoints for key CRUD and usage tracking.",API,Feature,P1,5,"area/api,area/security,kind/feature",V1,"API-01,PERF-02","API keys can be created/rotated/revoked; quotas enforced; usage metrics tracked per key."
TEST-01,Expand Integration Test Coverage for API Endpoints,"Add comprehensive integration tests for API endpoints covering auth flows, error cases, edge scenarios, and CORS. Focus on gaps in current test suite.",Testing,Task,P1,3,"area/testing,kind/test",V1,API-01,"Test coverage >80% for API endpoints; all auth flows tested; error cases covered."
OPS-02,Add OpenTelemetry Observability Stack,"Implement distributed tracing and metrics using OpenTelemetry. Integrate with Jaeger/Tempo for traces and Prometheus for metrics. Current setup only has Serilog logging.",Ops,Feature,P2,5,"area/ops,kind/infra",V2,INF-01,"OpenTelemetry SDK integrated; traces exported to Jaeger; metrics exported to Prometheus; dashboards configured."
UI-06,RuleSpec Version Diff Viewer,"Implement frontend UI to visualize differences between RuleSpec versions. Backend version history API already exists - add side-by-side diff view with highlighting.",UI,Feature,P2,3,"area/ui,area/rulespec,kind/feature",V1,"EDIT-02,RULE-02","Diff viewer shows changes between versions; added/removed/modified rules highlighted; navigable version history."
API-05,Streaming Responses for RAG Explain,"Implement Server-Sent Events (SSE) or streaming responses for /agents/qa endpoint to improve UX with progressive token delivery instead of waiting for complete response.",API,Feature,P1,3,"area/api,area/ai,kind/feature",V1,"API-02,AI-02","SSE endpoint returns tokens progressively; frontend displays streaming responses; graceful fallback for unsupported clients."
SEC-04,Security Audit and SAST Integration,"Conduct comprehensive security audit and integrate SAST tools (Snyk/Semgrep) into CI pipeline. Pre-commit hooks exist but need full dependency scanning and vulnerability assessment.",Security,Task,P0,5,"area/security,kind/ci",MVP,"SEC-03,INF-02","SAST integrated in CI; dependency scanning active; security audit completed; critical vulnerabilities addressed."
