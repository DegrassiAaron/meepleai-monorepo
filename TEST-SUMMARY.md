# Test Implementation Summary

_Last updated: 2025-01-06_

## Latest Execution Results

| Suite | Command | Outcome | Key Notes |
|-------|---------|---------|-----------|
| Backend (`apps/api`) | `dotnet build` | ✅ **Success:** 0 errors, 0 warnings | Compilation successful; test execution blocked by Docker requirement. |
| Backend (`apps/api`) | `dotnet test --no-build` | ⏱️ **Timeout:** hangs after 2 minutes | Integration tests require Docker/Testcontainers; local environment lacks Docker daemon. |
| Frontend (`apps/web`) | `npm run test -- --coverage` | ✅ **Success:** 65/65 tests passed | Coverage improving: 81.20% statements, 76.01% branches (+14 tests added). |

## Coverage Totals

| Suite | Statements | Branches | Functions | Lines | Coverage Source |
|-------|------------|----------|-----------|-------|-----------------|
| Backend (`apps/api`) | — | — | — | — | Not available (tests timeout before coverage collection) |
| Frontend (`apps/web`) | 81.20% | 76.01% | 81.17% | 81.41% | `apps/web/coverage/lcov.info` (generated 2025-01-06, Phase 1+2) |

> **Note:** Backend Cobertura reports do not expose statement/function aggregates; lines and branches are the comparable metrics available.

## Untested / Low-Tested Areas

### Backend
- **Integration tests blocked**: All integration tests requiring Docker (Qdrant, PostgreSQL via Testcontainers) cannot run without Docker daemon.
- **Coverage collection blocked**: No coverage data available until test suite can complete successfully.
- **Recommendation**: Set up Docker or use `--filter` to run only unit tests for coverage collection.

### Frontend (Current Coverage - After Phase 1+2)
- **Critical gap**:
  - `upload.tsx`: 65.01% statements, 47.91% functions — biggest impact opportunity, needs multi-step wizard tests
- **Good coverage achieved**:
  - `logs.tsx`: **90%+** after 6 new tests (was 76.31%)
  - `chat.tsx`: **88%+** after 3 new tests (was 86.41%)
  - `editor.tsx`: **85%+** after 5 new tests (was 79.50%)
  - `index.tsx`: 90.78% statements — meets threshold
  - `api/health.ts`: 100% coverage — full coverage
- **Need fine-tuning**:
  - `admin.tsx`: 72.58% statements, 58.33% branches
  - `n8n.tsx`: 88.23% statements, 64.63% branches
  - `versions.tsx`: 87.61% statements

## Tooling & Reproduction Checklist

1. **Install prerequisites**
   - .NET 8 SDK (use `https://dot.net/v1/dotnet-install.sh --version 8.0.100` if the CLI is unavailable).
   - Docker Desktop or another Docker daemon to satisfy Testcontainers.
   - Node.js 20.x + npm (CI uses Node 20).

2. **Run backend tests with coverage**
   ```bash
   cd apps/api
   dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"
   # (2025-10-05: hangs after integration suites; run alongside a pre-started Postgres + Qdrant service or use CI.)
   # Coverage: apps/api/tests/Api.Tests/TestResults/<timestamp>/coverage.cobertura.xml
   ```

3. **Run frontend tests with coverage**
   ```bash
   cd apps/web
   npm install
   npm run test -- --coverage   # or npm run test:coverage
   # Coverage: apps/web/coverage/lcov.info + coverage/lcov-report/
   ```

4. **Optional reports**
   - Install `dotnet reportgenerator` to create HTML dashboards from Cobertura output.
   - Open `apps/web/coverage/lcov-report/index.html` in a browser for the Jest HTML report.

## Next Focus Areas

1. ✅ ~~**Fix failing frontend test**~~ - Resolved via #253 (AdminDashboard test now passes, 51/51 tests passing)
2. **Improve frontend coverage**: Focus on `upload.tsx` (65.01%), `admin.tsx` (72.58%), and `logs.tsx` (76.31%) to reach 90% global thresholds.
3. **Backend Docker setup**: Install Docker Desktop to enable integration tests, or configure test filtering to run unit tests only.
4. **Backend coverage collection**: Once Docker is available (or filtering is configured), collect baseline coverage metrics with `dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"`.
