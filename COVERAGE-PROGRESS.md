# Coverage Progress Report

## 📊 Snapshot — 2025-01-06 (Updated after Phase 1+2)

- **Backend (`apps/api`)**: `dotnet build` completes successfully with **0 errors, 0 warnings**. However, `dotnet test` hangs during integration test execution (likely Docker/Testcontainers-related), preventing coverage collection. Build is healthy; test suite requires Docker environment to complete.
- **Frontend (`apps/web`)**: `npm run test -- --coverage` completed with coverage at **81.20% statements / 76.01% branches / 81.17% functions / 81.41% lines** (10 suites, 65 tests: **all passed**). Jest fails on 90% global thresholds but test suite is healthy and improving steadily.

## 🧪 Latest Commands Executed

- `dotnet build` (inside `apps/api`, ✅ successful)
- `dotnet test --no-build` (inside `apps/api`, ⏱️ timeout after 2 minutes)
- `npm run test -- --coverage` (inside `apps/web`, ⚠️ threshold failures but tests pass)

## 🔍 Coverage Gaps & Follow-up Items

### Backend

- **Integration test hang**: Tests hang during execution, likely at Docker-dependent integration tests (`QdrantServiceIntegrationTests`). Requires Docker environment to complete.
- **Coverage collection blocked**: Cannot generate Cobertura reports until test suite completes. Consider running tests with Docker available or skipping integration tests for local coverage runs.
- **Next steps**: Set up Docker Desktop, or use `dotnet test --filter` to exclude integration tests and collect coverage for unit tests only.

### Frontend

- ✅ **Fixed failing test**: AdminDashboard test now passes (issue #253 resolved).
- ✅ **Phase 1 completed**: Added 9 tests total to logs.test.tsx and chat.test.tsx
- ✅ **Phase 2 completed**: Added 5 tests to editor.test.tsx covering validation and error handling
- **Next priority - upload.tsx**: Statements (65.01%) and functions (47.91%) remain the biggest gap; needs comprehensive test coverage for multi-step wizard flow
- **Fine-tuning needed**: Target branch coverage in `admin.tsx`, `n8n.tsx`, and `index.tsx` to push from 81% to 90%

## 📂 Coverage Artifacts

- Backend Cobertura report: **not generated** (tests hang before completion). Expected path once Docker environment is available: `apps/api/tests/Api.Tests/TestResults/<timestamp>/coverage.cobertura.xml`.
- Frontend LCOV report: `apps/web/coverage/lcov.info` (HTML at `apps/web/coverage/lcov-report/index.html`).

## ✅ Suggested Next Steps

1. **Backend**: Set up Docker Desktop to enable integration tests, or exclude integration tests using `dotnet test --filter "Category!=Integration"` to collect unit test coverage only.
2. **Frontend**: ✅ ~~Fix the one failing test~~ (resolved via #253). Next: improve coverage for `upload.tsx`, `admin.tsx`, and `n8n.tsx` to reach Jest's 90% global thresholds.
3. Re-run coverage commands after Docker setup to generate fresh Cobertura reports for backend.
